# me
This is a semver representation of me starting at version 3 for some reason

## Semver Guidance

> This is a WIP

### Major

- A major bump is given at the introduction of the topic becoming truly usable to me.  This happens when you enter a new universe.
- This does not meant I read a blog on `postgres`.
- The growth in knowledge has to result in my ability to use it.

Ex: Learning Svelte or NoSql databases to a point where I can use it on a project.  Sure I'll have bugs like every other new major version bump, thats ok.

### Minor

Minor bumps come from learning new skill in a technology you already know; they show progress and exploration in my current universe.

Ex: Learning React's context api or learning how to troubleshoot performance in a SPA.

### Patch

A patch is something that contributes to a skill I already posess.  This can equate to finding out something cool about your universe that is helpful.

Ex: Learning how to use React's function components or learning how to use css variables.
