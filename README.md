## Possible Semver Guidance

> This is a WIP

A bump in all of these areas requires mid to advanced knowldege.  Reading a blog about web performance does not qualify for a semver bump.

- Major: Learning a new technology or framework.  Ex: Learning Svelte or NoSql databases
- Minor: Learning new skill in a technology you already know. Ex: Learning React's context api
- Patch: Something that contributes to a skill you already posess.  Ex: Learning how to use React's function components
