## 4.0.0 - 2021-02-15

The fullstack svelte course has been completed.  Taking this course exposed me to moderate level use of svelte, node, express, and postgres.  The basics of the app were to create a multi tenant service for different schools to create lunch menus.  Each login for a different school makes a new database for that school.  The app uses Auth0 for authentication.

### Issues closed:
